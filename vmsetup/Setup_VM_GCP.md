#  1. Introduction
This tutorial describes the steps in creating a virtual machine (VM) on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The VM can run an end-to-end 5G network based on the OpenAirInterface (OAI) software stack in an RF simulated (RFsim) mode. 

## 1.1 Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have an access to your GCP account. If you do not have one, you can sign up with your google account at   [https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com)

Depending on the country you are located, generally you have some free credits to try the GCP products. If you haven't used them already, these free credits would be enough to have a hands-on experience with OAI for few days.

## 1.2 Computing Requirements
To run an end-to-end 5G network with OAI Core Network (CN),
Radio Access Network (RAN) including base station (gNB) and user equipment (nrUE) in RFsim mode, we should have the following minimum recommended computing requirements: 
-  Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
-  CPU: 8 cores x86_64 @ 3.5 GHz
- RAM: 32 GB

We will now create a VM on the GCP that satisfies these requirements.

# 2. VM Creation

**Step 1:  Accessing the console and creating a project**

1.  Open your web browser and login to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  If you are using GCP for the first time, you will not any projects. If you donâ€™t have a project yet, you can create a new project and then select it.

If you already have projects and are familier with GCP you can select any of your project.

3. After succesfull project creation, the project dashboard looks like this with your given project name

**Step 2:  Creating a VM Instance**
 
1. Select the "Compute Engine" and then "VM instances" to create a new VM instance from your project dashboard.
2. Click on the "CREATE INSTANCE" button
3. Enter a name to your VM instance and then choose the region. Prefarbly select a region closest to yours for better performance.
4. Choose "General purpose" Machine Configuration. OAI is relaibaly tested on x86 architecture and requires Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX2) instructions. The AVX2 instructions are supported by starting from Intel Haswell platforms. Therfore choose a "series" that respects these constraints. An example tested configuration is shown in the figure below.
7. USe the "CUSTOM" option to set your machine type. We require atleast 8vCPU cores (4 physical cores) and 16 GB of RAM. An example tested configuration is shown in the figure below.

8. If you wnat to use screen caputuring and recording you can enable the "Display device" option
9. Using the "Boot disk" option choose the **x86 Ubuntu 22.04** operating system as shown below

 ![Console](./resources/console_7.png)
 
10. In the "Firewall" enable HTTP and HTTPs traffic and in "Advanced options->Networking" enable the "IP forwarding" as shown below

![Console](./resources/console_8.png)

11. Check if the installation is correct by using "uname" for OS and kernel and check if the AVX2 instructions are there with `lscpu | grep avx2`
12.  VM instances status bar. When you are not using the VM you can shutdown it so that you do not consume you credits. However, do not delete till you are done with this tutorial or your project. Otherwise, you have to re-create another VM follwing all steps.
